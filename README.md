# 3button_hangul_typer
for my cousin
This is a Korean typewriter made for my cousin who is uncomfortable to use hands.


Using arduino uno, I made a 3 button-typer for typing korean letter ( maximun 4 letters)


3button_hangul_typer_1, 
3button_hangul_typer_2    ->  these are made during the process of making


3button_hangul_typer_completed    -> this is the final one
